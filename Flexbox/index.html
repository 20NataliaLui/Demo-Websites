<div class="flex-container">
    <div id="f1">Welcome to my page on flexboxes. The term "Flexbox" was coined after "Flexible" + "Box". Ingenious. Like its name, the use of flexible boxes are detrimental to a good website. Not only do you need a nice background, interactive elements, and correct information, but do you need your website to be seen on multiple devices. If your website only works on computers with a specific screen size then only people with that type of computer will be able to view your work.<br><br>Sometimes, when you navigate a page and you gotta make it smaller, does some content randomly disappear? Yes, there is definitely a solution to that problem. It is known as Flexboxes. Fortunately, it's easy to inegrate responsive web design into every website. While some creators may like using Tables and Bootstrap, FlexBox is just as good. Regardless of what you choose, responsive web design is just an important facet of creating and maintaining a web page. <br><br>Flexboxes are very useful for responsive web design. Although it may be difficult to learn, the application of flexboxes allows webpages to increase their convenience. By doing so, users will obtain the utmost experience on the web page and maybe want to see more of your content. Certain websites such as YouTube and Google use responsive web design to make their content easy to see. Other websites utilize flexboxes so that, regardless of a device's size, the page itself will not hide content. It is like customizing a bike, but the bike has products and can make money just by moving and being easy to use<br><br>Although this may seem very difficult to manage at first, it gets much easier down the road. The whole point of flexboxes is to make it much easier for you and your user to get the most out of your website. It also makes the design of the page responsive to everyone's device size. For example, if you have an iPhone and your friend has a tablet, you will both be able to view the website and experience the same functions. Through flexbox, it is easier to access all types of media from all devices.</div>
    <div><p id="f2">Down below is an example of what flexboxes can do. With the practice game, Froggy Flexbox, you can learn how to manipulate flexboxes easily. The objective of Froggy Flexbox is to navigate the froggies to their corresonding lilypad. Sometimes, it is difficult to do, but if you follow the directions and conduct one or two google searches, it is simple. I recommend completing this with a friend. You may compete or collaborate.</p><img id="f3" src="Flexbox-Froggy-Lui.png" width="65%" alt="Flexbox Froggy"></div></div>
